# Lab 12: Terraform CI/CD on Azure with GitHub Actions

## 6. Create the GitHub Actions workflows

Create several GitHub Actions workflows to automate the CI/CD process for the application infrastructure Terraform configuration. The workflows will run static code analysis, integration tests, and deploy the infrastructure to Azure.

> [!TIP]
> Read the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to learn more about GitHub Actions.
> The [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) reference docs will also be helpful.
