CST8918 - DevOps: Infrastructure as Code  
Prof. Robert McKenney

# Lab 12: Terraform CI/CD on Azure with GitHub Actions

## 6. Create the GitHub Actions workflows
### 6.4 Daily drift detection

Configuration drift is a common issue in infrastructure as code (IaC) environments. Drift occurs when the deployed infrastructure does not match the desired state defined in the Terraform configuration. This can happen due to manual changes made to the infrastructure, or changes made outside of the Terraform configuration, i.e. when there are a mix of tools being used.

The final workflow will run daily to detect drift between the deployed infrastructure and the Terraform configuration. This workflow will be triggered on a schedule (like a CRON task), running once a day.

Create a new GitHub Actions workflow in the `.github/workflows` folder called `infra-drift-detection.yml`. Add the following content to the file.

### Test it out

Commit the changes to your local repository and then push the changes to GitHub. The workflow will run at the next scheduled time, but you can test it by running the workflow manually in the Actions tab of your repository.

[!TIP]
> You can only trigger the workflow manually if you have the `workflow_dispatch` event in the `on` section of the workflow file, and the workflow file is merged into the main branch.

You can simulate drift by making a manual change to the deployed infrastructure in the Azure portal. This could be changing a tag, adding a resource, or changing a configuration setting. When the workflow runs, it will detect the drift and create a new issue in the repository.
